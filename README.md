# Text-Summarization
## Introduction
Often there are many situations where we don’t have/get enough time to read and understand lengthy documents, research papers, or news articles. Similarly, summarizing a large volume of text while retaining essential information is crucial in many fields, such as journalism, research, and business. This is where NLP text summarization comes into play, which is a technique that automatically generates a condensed version of a given text while preserving its essential meaning. In this article, we will explore the two main approaches of NLP text summarization, namely extractive and abstractive, and examine their applications, strengths, and weaknesses.

Learning Objectives

In this article, you will:

1. Understand the different categories of text vectorization.
2. Understanding extractive and abstraction approach through examples.
3. Learn the difference between both vectorization techniques.
And the future aspects of text summarization.

### Types of Text Summarization
Broadly, the NLP text summarization can be divided into two main categories.
1. Extractive Approach
2. Abstractive Approach

Let’s dive a little deeper into each of the above-mentioned categories

#### Extractive Summarization
So, what exactly happens in the extractive summarization method? It simply takes out the important sentences or phrases from the original text and joins them to form a summar
Now, the question that comes is, exactly on what basis are those sentences termed as important? So, basically, a ranking algorithm is used, which assigns scores to each of the sentences in the text based on their relevance to the overall meaning of the document. The most relevant sentences are then chosen to be included in the summary.

There are various ways through which the ranking of sentences can be performed.
TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency)
Graph-based methods such as TextRank
Machine learning-based methods such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests.

The main motive of the extractive method is to maintain the original meaning of the text. Also, this method works well when the input text/content is already in a well-structured manner, both physically and logically, just like the content in newspapers.
### Abstractive Summarization
Okay, now let’s come to the abstractive summarization method. The name itself implies that it has arrived from the root form of the word abstract, which means outline/summary or the basic idea of a voluminous thing(text). Now unlike the extractive method, it simply doesn’t pick out the important sentences, rather, it analyses the input text and generates new phrases or sentences that capture the essence of the original text and convey the same meaning as the original text but more concisely and coherently.

Again, how exactly is the summary generated in this method? So, in brief, the input text is analyzed by a neural network model that learns to generate new phrases and sentences that capture the essence of the original text. The model is trained on large amounts of text data and learns to understand the relationships between words and sentences, and generates new text that conveys the same meaning as the original text in a more understandable manner.

This method uses advanced NLP techniques such as natural language generation (NLG) and deep learning to understand the context and generate the summary. The resulting summaries are usually shorter and more readable than the ones generated by the extractive method, but they can sometimes contain errors or inaccuracies.

Note that, here in this article, we’ll only deal with the extractive text summarization method.

Understanding with Code
Here, we’ll focus on the extractive method and understand it more with an example.

But, before that, let’s quickly understand it with a flowchart.



Here, we will use a Python library called NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) to implement the extractive method. NLTK provides a wide range of functionalities for natural language processing, including text tokenization, stopword removal, and sentence scoring.

Let’s take a look at the following code that demonstrates how to use NLTK to generate a summary from a given text:

Frequency-based Approach
